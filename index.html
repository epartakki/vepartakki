      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are sisters <strong>Eleni Partakki</strong> and <strong>Victoria Partakki</strong>, daughters of the late
        <strong>Demetris Partakkis</strong> — a great man, a farmer, and our lifelong inspiration. Guided by his values
        of hard work, integrity, and love for the land, we continue his legacy through our shared passion for both
        farming and engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our business is a unique blend of agriculture and innovation. On our farm, we produce fresh, locally grown goods
        with care and respect for the environment. In our engineering space, we design and build practical tools,
        systems, and workshops that empower farmers, makers, and our local community.
